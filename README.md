Hi, I'm Chris!

I'm interested in Qt/C++ software development with low dependencies, meaning that most of my projects won't have dependencies beyond Qt.

I'm mostly interested in how things work (and implementing this in a software) rather than being efficient and expedient to reach any other goal. If you're the same, you've come to the right place. Gimme a shout and we can chat about my projects or yours!

I am by no means a professional software developer, and in fact have never been paid to write any code and have not had any position in IT jobs. It's just a hobby that I've pursued for over 40 years now. I've been writing code on a number of platforms in a number of low- and high-level languages. I'm currenly on macOS and write C++ code.

My original training is in mathematics, and I have a thing for algorithms!
